"``No'' on rollcall 733, the Dent Amendment, which would further  undermine environmental protections by adding EPA's National Emission  Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Portland Cement  Manufacturing Industry and Standards of Performance for Portland Cement  Plants to the rules the must be examined by the interagency committee  created by the bill.",,0.0,1.0
"Things are only going to get worse if we do nothing. If we take our  moral responsibility as stewards of this Earth seriously, it is  imperative that we face the challenge of reversing the effects of  climate change head on and have a sober discussion about what actions  we will need to take now and in the future. America clearly has the  capacity to become energy independent. But we also need to transition  from our current energy portfolio to one that produces as much or more  power with substantially less carbon pollution per kilowatt hour.",,0.0,0.0
"The solid black line here indicates the oil that we have used. And  the world was in a very happy position up until about 1980. Every year  until 1980, we found more oil, sometimes a lot more oil, than we used  that year. If you integrate under this curve, you will get the total  volume of oil that we have used. So this area represents the volume of  oil that we have used.",,0.0,1.0

"Lion Oil Company will spend more than $21.5 million to install state- of-the-art pollution control technologies throughout its refinery.  Additionally, the company will pay $348,000 in civil penalties and  spend more than $450,000 on supplemental environmental projects.",,0.0,0.0
"Now, I have legislation that will open up the Outer Continental  Shelf, and it's vital that we do that. It's vital that we produce,  because we, every electric generating plant we have built recently is  natural gas. So if we continue to have a hot summer, we will use a  tremendous amount of electricity. In hot weather, they turn on the gas  plants, peaker plants. Before, 12 years ago, we only used natural gas  for peaking plants. That was high use in the morning and high use at  night, but where they were not allowed to run during the day, only in  emergency.",,1.0,1.0
"Leonard has personally received numerous national honors in  recognition of his outstanding leadership, including Platts Global  Energy CEO of the Year, the Anti-Defamation League Torch of Liberty  Award, and the National Wildlife Federation Achievement Award.

"There are some other points I will bring to the attention of the  Senate at this time relative to the state we are in. This came about as  a release last week from the Center for Strategic and International  Studies, a well-renowned defense and foreign policy think tank here in  Washington. It includes scholars, both moderates and conservatives,  from both parties, and their conclusion in a three-volume, 3-year  effort entitled ``Geopolitics of Energy into the 21st Century.''",,0.0,0.0
"There is also $12 million for us to build a new greenhouse for  orchids for the Arboretum. We may need to do that. There is no question  we should preserve the things that mark our heritage. But is now the  time to build a new greenhouse in Maryland to grow orchids? Is it the  time? What can we do with that $12 million? Who could we help with that  $12 million? Could we use it in a better, more efficient way so that  the American people would benefit? If we are going to spend $12  million, couldn't we spend it in a better way?",,0.0,0.0
"Wind, like solar and other renewables, by its nature is intermittent,  even in places like South Dakota, where wind is a regular feature. And  because technology has not yet advanced to the point where we can store  up sufficient renewable energy to power an electric grid, even places  like my State that rely heavily on renewables for electricity  generation depend on conventional energy sources like coal and natural  gas to keep the power on consistently.",,1.0,1.0

"We all know that the American shale revolution has dramatically  improved our energy security at home and our economic opportunity for  hard-working Americans. The United States is now the number one  producer of oil and gas in the world, yet we are in the midst of new  challenges due to a lack of appropriate infrastructure to bring those  resources to our consumers.",,1.0,1.0
"One hundred years ago, the Model T got 25 miles per gallon. Now a car  gets 28 miles per gallon. Since that time, we have split the atom, sent  a man to the Moon, developed computers, and mapped out the human  genome. Yet we get the same fuel efficiency? Come on. That is not  right. Conservation is the easiest and cheapest thing we can do to keep  energy costs down.",,0.0,0.0
"And the assumptions fall down to this. They assume that greenhouse  gasses emitted by industry in the world, a lot of it from the United  States, bring about more clouds in our atmosphere. Now, I can't quite  explain why that is, but they believe that is. So if it is more clouds  in the atmosphere, that is one assumption.",,0.0,2.0
"It is not enough just to transform it. We need to ensure our  investments create good-paying jobs, revitalize American manufacturing,  help us compete in the clean energy economy, and lead the world once  again, as we were the envy of the world in the 1970s and up to about  the early 1980s.",,0.0,0.0

"Why are they doing this? The Chinese economy is growing at over 10  percent. The last quarter for which I saw data was 11.4 percent. They  have to have observed that oil is fungible; that it really doesn't  matter who owns the oil, which is why I didn't have any big problem  with them buying Unocal. It doesn't really matter who owns the oil. The  country, the company that gets the oil is the high bidder because oil  moves in a global marketplace. Today, it was roughly $61 a barrel. So  it doesn't make one bit of difference who owns the oil. The person who  has the money, who bids the highest, gets the oil.",,0.0,0.0
