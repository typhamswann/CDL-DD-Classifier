"In the first post in this series, we discussed a number of animations of maps and animations of equatorial cross sections available from the NOAA Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) website. Each cell of the animation is a 5-day (pentadal) average. Those animations ran from January 3 rd to March 29 th . The following are updates, again starting in January 3 rd . GODAS only maintains their animations for 3 months. Ive stored the maps since the first of the year and will continue to add maps as time progresses. That way we can watch the El Nio unfold from the beginning and then try to keep track of the warm water when El Nio is over.",,0.0,0.0
"Then. we continue to be drenched with stories claiming the continued effects of global warming. Yet the preferred technique for assessing this properly, the Mean Annual Global Surface Temperature Anomaly Record (which has been used to claim global warming in all previous IPCC Reports) has now been practically constant with little change for over 18 years. The excuses they give are pitiful.",,2.0,2.0
"Korhola: ???In late summer 2008 I was in England, where all newspapers ran a front-page story about a scenario predicting the total disappearance of Arctic sea ice by that summer. And these predictions were distributed by two leading researchers of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, Mark Serreze and Jay Zwally. Well, what happened was that these predictions did not come true, but that 2008 was clearly a better year than 2007 with the collapse in ice extent, which was apparently caused by anomalous atmospheric pressure and wind conditions in the Arctic regions.??",,2.0,1.0

"President Obama has also claimedhe can block the Suns rays to end global warming . In addition, Obama made the completely scientifically indefensible claim that the Waxman-Markey climate bill in 2009 would stop global temperature increases of up to five degrees!

"CO2-Enriched Seawater and the Self-Righting Ability of Gastropods (19 Nov 2013) The authors of this study conclude that C. concholepas have the ability to maintain calcification even at pCO2 levels of 1036 atm ... in agreement with similar results reported in the literature for other invertebrates... And they say that during their early ontogeny, exposure to elevated pCO2 may actually increase the likelihood of C. concholepas surviving after being overturned by an exogenous cause...

"Everyone knows that different climate models predict both higher and lower rainfall in the same areas at the same time, and the type of phrases used to describe the ability of climate models are: low confidence ( National Centre for Atmospheric Research ), irrelevant with reality (Koutsoyiannis ), or an absence of skill (Kiktev).

"Another reader has asked why I have calculated the effect of implementing the Copenhagen Accord only as far as 2020. This is the time-horizon for the Accord. The effect of the Accord over ten years would be to forestall warming of just 0. 0 2 C (0. 0 35 F) forestalled even if everyone complies fully. This outcome is so minuscule that extending the analysis beyond that date would be pointless, not least because by ten years from now it will be blindingly obvious to everyone a) that the climate is simply not warming anything like as fast (if at all) as the IPCC had ambitiously predicted, and b) that compliance with Copenhagen was little better than compliance with Kyoto. By 2020, the climate scare will be all over bar the shouting, and no one will be cutting CO2 emissions any more.",,1.0,2.0
