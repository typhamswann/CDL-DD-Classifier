4. **Assign Categories**: Based on the closest matches, assign the appropriate claim numbers from the codebook to the text. If the text mentions multiple claims, you may need to list several numbers.

5. **Check for Accuracy**: Double-check to ensure that the categories you've assigned accurately reflect the claims made in the text. Adjust if necessary.
