"""I have been brooding about the cumulative void. First we lost Milton Friedman, who died in November 2006, then William F. Buckley, Jr., in February 2008, and then on September 18, Irving Kristol.

But the very truth of that statementwe are indeed in a battle for America's soulmakes it a good idea to stop and think about when the American Right was truly influential. It didn't start after right-wing talk shows got big. It started in the 1960s, as Friedman, Buckley, and Kristol were hitting their stride. . . .

"The flaw in the UN reasoning is clear, however. The alarmists claim the global warming since 1976 has been too rapid to be caused by natural forces, and therefore must be man-made.

"We show that although these anthropogenic forcings share a common stochastic trend, this trend is empirically independent of the stochastic trend in temperature and solar irradiance. Therefore, greenhouse gas forcing, aerosols, solar irradiance and global temperature are not polynomially cointegrated. This implies that recent global warming is not statistically significantly related to anthropogenic forcing. On the other hand, we find that greenhouse gas forcing might have had a temporary effect on global temperature.",2,2,2.0,"[2.1, 2.2]",[2.2]
"According to that index, in 2002 the influence of greenhouse gases on surface temperatures was 1.166 of that in 1990. In 2013 the index is 1.338.

Despite these and other tergiversations, the duo resist the label ""neoliberal,"" not simply out of discomfort with the symmetry of the now-dreaded ""neoconservative"" but also because they think the neoliberalism of the 1980s and 1990s conceded too much to minimal-state libertarianism.
