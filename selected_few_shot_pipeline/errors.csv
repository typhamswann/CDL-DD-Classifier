"The University of Colorados Sea Level Research Group decided in May to add 0.3 millimeters -- or about the thickness of a fingernail -- every year to its actual measurements of sea levels, sparking criticism from experts who called it an attempt to exaggerate the effects of global warming.",0,2.0,"[1.6, 5.1, 5.3]","[1.6, 5.1, 5.3]"
"Ethanol and Air Pollution. Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims a net decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from using ethanol, they recognize that ethanol use is a problem for conventional air pollutants. Ethanol use, according to the EPA, will increase the emission of chemicals that lead to the production of ozone, one of the nation's most challenging local air pollutants.",0,1.0,[4.5],[4.5]
"A new paper finds that over the past decade the global average effective cloud height has declined and that If sustained, such a decrease would indicate a significant measure of negative cloud feedback to global warming.",2,0.0,"[1.4, 2.1, 3.1]",[]
"Our guess is that this is the real political purpose behind the wave of new drilling rules. The Administration has made coal its main fossil-fuel target, but the green lobby also has natural gas in its sights. A frontal assault is too politically risky, which is why regulatory attrition is the preferred approach.",0,2.0,"[4.1, 4.4, 5.2]","[4.1, 5.2]"
"While science can inform policymakers, it can't determine policy. Policymakers must do cost/benefit analysis, taking into account tradeoffs, such as balancing risks from climate change against those from poverty, and as Hans von Storch points out, ""judgments of the value of costs versus benefits is a highly subjective, value-laden calculation.""",0,1.0,"[4.3, 4.4]",[4.3]
"""We suggest that the qualitative projections for dramatic reductions in population numbers and range are overly pessimistic given the response of polar bears, climate, and sea ice to the present,"" Canadian scientists wrote.",0,2.0,"[3.1, 3.2]",[3.2]
Part 4 - Reduced anthropogenic aerosols (and clouds seeded by anthropogenic aerosols) are the cause of most the observed warming in the land surface over the last 60 years,2,0.0,[2.1],[]
"This is confirmed by the annual Atlantic Ocean Sea Level data. Refer to Figure 8. Atlantic Ocean Sea Levels remained relatively flat in 2006, then dropped in 2007. http://i34.tinypic.com/m7b994.jpg Figure 8",2,0.0,[1.6],[]
"To stay warm, thousands of elderly are using travel passes to ride buses all day, while others seek refuge in libraries and shopping centers, the Sunday Express noted. Others are ""putting their health at risk, in an attempt to keep costs down,"" by bundling up and turning the heat down or off entirely, said Age UK Charity Director Michelle Mitchell.",0,1.0,[4.1],[4.1]
"Its announced goal of imposing global limits on greenhouse gas emissions will not be mandatory and ?President Obama has effectively gutted any meaningful agreement among the major industrialized nations, by having granted to the planet?s largest CO2 producer, China, free license to build as many coal power plants as they wish, and emit as many gigatons of greenhouse gases as they wish until 2030.?",0,1.0,"[4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5.2]","[4.1, 4.2]"
"Its clear that the world was warmer during medieval times. Marked on the map are study after study (all peer-reviewed) from all around the world with results of temperatures from the medieval time compared to today. These use ice cores, stalagmites, sediments, and isotopes. They agree with 6,144 boreholes around the world which found that temperatures were about 0.5C warmer world wide.",2,0.0,"[2.1, 5.1]",[]

"3) The carbon-dioxide issue is not about the United States anymore. Sure, the U.S. is the world's second-largest energy consumer. But over the past decade, carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S. fell by 1.7%. And according to the International Energy Agency, the U.S. is now cutting carbon emissions faster than Europe, even though the European Union has instituted an elaborate carbon-trading/pricing scheme. Why? The U.S. is producing vast quantities of cheap natural gas from shale, which is displacing higher-carbon coal.",0,1.0,"[4.2, 4.7]","[4.2, 4.7]"
