but I have always felt these Latin words describe my approach on 
energy: totus porcus. I think that means ``whole hog.'' I believe we 
ought to do everything we can and do it well. Should we maximize 
renewables? Yes. Should we drill in areas where there is oil and gas 
domestically? The answer is yes. Should we proceed with ethanol and the

outside of natural variances; No. 2, if that is the case, is it due to 
anthropogenic gasses--methane, CO2. I suggest science does

could predict weather for 100 years, only three of them had brought 
their umbrellas to that meeting. What does that tell you? You cannot 
predict what the weather is going to be like 2 weeks from now. And if 
it is just 1 degree over 100 years, they are telling us that we are 
going to be so frightened out of our wits by that that we are going to 
submit to a global treaty that would give powers over our economy and 
bring down our standard of living, exempt Communist China and let them 
get all the development? No way. One degree over 100 years is this 
thing that they are fearful about. And at the same time, let us go back 
to that basic fact that we were just discussing. There have been 
changes in the earth's temperature many, many times. Even if that 1 
degree over 100 years was right and, by the way, we do not know how 
they took the temperatures 100 years ago. We do not know who was taking 
the temperature down in some Pacific Ocean place. Was it a sailor who 
was reading the thermometer right or what about the guys out west or 
out in the jungles or something? Who was taking these temperatures 100 
years ago? How do we know that it was 1 degree cooler 100 years ago? I 
would doubt that it is 1 degree warmer, it might be, but if it was and

great. I cannot find a group that says they are not. Charles Rivers 
Associates. Sure, you can say the CRA is not a credible group. Nobody 
is going to say that because he is credible. They are saying if we had 
enacted the watered-down version of McCain-Lieberman, it would have 
cost the economy $507 billion in 2020, $525 billion in 2025. 
Implementing Kyoto would cost--and we are talking about this in the 
resolution--$305 billion in 2010; $243 billion in 2020. It would result 
in an annual loss per household of $2,780 by 2010. That means, for 
every household of four people, the average it is going to cost them. 
Don't let anyone tell you that the economic impact is anything but 
disastrous. When the CRA International studied the job loss, it stated 
that under the watered-down version, we would lose 840,000 U.S. jobs in 
2010; 1.3 million jobs in 2020; and implementing the Kyoto would mean 
job loss in the economy of 2.4 million jobs in 2010 and 1.7 million 
jobs in 2020. Energy prices--this is the economy we are talking about--
would increase. There would be a 28-percent increase for gasoline, a 
28-percent increase for electricity, 47-percent increase for gas, and 
it would be astronomical in terms of the cost of coal. These are the 
things that we turned around and wisely voted down in a meaningful 
bill. And I don't question the sincerity of McCain-Lieberman. They 
really believe in this. Nonetheless, cooler heads did prevail, and now 
we have a cover vote and people will come forth and say I am voting for

serious side effects when one gets you focused on something that's not

you wouldn't do otherwise. When you have CO2 being called 
the primary pollutant for concern, you are doing a horrendous 
disservice to the people of this country. By focusing on 
CO2, which is not harmful to human beings at all and in fact 
is a plant food--CO2 makes plants grow better, it does not 
harm human beings. And if our job is just to try to reduce the amount 
of CO2 in the world, we will actually be doing a grave

the world, greenhouses, sometimes they're called hothouses, are growing

this resolution is really about is whether the American people, through 
their elected representatives, get a say in our Nation's energy policy

Congress lowered the corporate tax rate for all manufacturers and

Companies in Delaware have taken some good measures to reduce

example, in the solar mode of operation, solar technology has no 
combustion-related emissions at all. Even when using back-up fossil

profligate use of fossil fuel energy. What you are really doing when 
you burn that waste to produce electricity is you are kind of burning 
secondhand fossil fuels because that's what was used to produce this 
waste. In an energy deficient world, there will be far, far less waste
