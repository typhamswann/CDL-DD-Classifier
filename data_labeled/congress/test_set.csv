years been able to form publicly traded entities called master limited 
partnerships, or MLPs. These partnerships include a passthrough tax 
structure that avoids double taxation and leaves more cash available to 
distribute to investors. They have for investors the liquidity and the 
return that is commonly associated with equity and the tax advantage 
that is associated with partnerships, and they have been able to 
aggregate and deploy a significant amount of private capital in the 
traditional fossil fuel marketplace, roughly $350 billion today across 
100 MLPs. They have access to private capital at a lower cost,

the analogy of a couple whose grandparents have died and left them a

lifestyle where 85 percent of the money they spend comes from the 
inheritance and only 15 percent earnings. They note with their age and 
the amount of inheritance and the way they are spending it, it is going 
to run out before they retire. They either have to spend less or make 
more or a combination. I use that 85-15 because it is pretty precisely 
where we are relative to energy. So 85 or 86 percent of our energy 
comes from fossil fuels: Coal, petroleum and natural gas. And only 15 
percent of it comes from what they call renewables, something other 
than these fossil fuels. More than half comes from nuclear here. So it 
leaves only 7 percent to come from the true renewables. And those that 
we will have to increasingly depend on in the future, and this is a 
2000 chart, solar was 1 percent of 7 percent. That is 0.07 percent. So 
today it is 5 or 6 times bigger. Big deal. It is still less than 1 
percent.",1
8,1083,"What I would like to point out, Mr. Speaker, is this chart that 
actually goes from 1750 up to the year 2000. We can see from 1750, 
1800, 1850, burning fossil fuel was minimal, so we do not increase 
CO2 in the atmosphere very much. But once we get into the 
1900s, especially 1950, CO2 increases in the atmosphere from 
burning fossil fuels has had a dramatic effect. CO2 is a 
naturally occurring element in the world. When we increase that element 
by the magnitude that we have, we have the potential for climate 
change.

ones who were talking about gobal cooling about 25 years ago, saying 
that another ice age is coming, that we are all going to die. On 
hurricanes, according to Dr. Christopher Lansey, one of the foremost 
experts today on hurricanes, he said that hurricanes are going to 
continue to hit the United States on the Atlantic and gulf coast, and 
the damage will probably be more extensive than in the past, but this 
is due to natural climate cycles, which cause hurricanes to be stronger 
and more frequent and rising property prices on the coast, not because 
of any affect of CO2 emissions on weather. He goes on to say 
that it is determined that the total number of Atlantic hurricanes 
making landfall in the United States decreased from the normalized 
trend of U.S. hurricanes. The damage reveals a decreasing rate. In 
other words, they are decreasing. Finally, contrary to the belief--this

greater environmental protection opportunities and better science. The 
bill now requires that all funded projects have ``a positive impact on 
watersheds, fish habitats, and wildlife diversity.'' It promotes 
reforestion activities for species that are native to a region. Also, 
the bill now allows flexibility in the loan repayment requirements that 
encourage the longer rotation, and permanent protection, of lands 
reforested under this program. In addition, the new Advisory Council 
will have three independent scientists instead of one and the members 
must have an expertise in forest management; carbon storage reporting

voting to support the 5.4 cent per gallon tax credit for ethanol, which 
ensures the ethanol tax credit will be in place until at least 2007--
something crucial to existing ethanol plants and to those considering 
new production facilities. I also led an effort, in cooperation with

only fair they share the slight increase in costs for generation of

Afghanistan and Pakistan were two of the issues that dominated the 
session. Many members of the Alliance questioned whether Russia has 
begun to implement an increasingly assertive security policy including 
efforts to intimidate neighboring states, through the threat of force. 
There was also concern expressed that Russia would continue to use its 
energy supplies as a political lever to influence European policy. It 
was clear from our meetings that not only the United States and NATO,

a variety of issues. And, while there were differences of opinion over 
how to structure future relations between NATO and Russia and the NATO 
PA and the Russian delegates to the Assembly, most felt that dialogue 
between NATO, the NATO PA, and Russia was important and should 
continue. Many delegates welcomed the U.S. commitment to a new, 
constructive relationship with Moscow and expressed hope that through 
those promising relations, Russia's attitude toward NATO could become 
more positive. On Afghanistan, there was continued support for the ISAF

there. However, we did detect an undercurrent of concern among some 
allies that through the commitment of 21,000 additional U.S. troops to 
Afghanistan and the replacement of U.S./ISAF Commander, General 
McKiernan, the process of the ``Americanization'' of the war was

were looking at the Kyoto treaty. We remember the Kyoto treaty, I say 
to the Presiding Officer, which was an agreement we would sign on to--
an international treaty, the Kyoto treaty--and we would agree to reduce 
all the CO2 in this country and all of that. Of course, that 
didn't happen, but the cost was discussed at that time. I remember back 
when Republicans were in the majority, I chaired the committee called 
the Environment and Public Works Committee, and some 12 years ago, 
about the time of Kyoto, I believed it was true--everybody said global 
warming was coming and we were all going to die. So I assumed it was 
true until I started exploring a little bit and hearing quietly from 
some of the scientists who said: Look. The whole thing is rigged and 
the science is not the same as the United Nations would have us 
believe. So one by one they started coming forth. I stood at this 
podium for about a 3-year period and started naming all of the 
scientists who said the U.N. scientists, the IPCC, were not being 
honest and that they had their own agenda they were trying to support. 
At that time, a group of several universities--MIT was one of them, the 
Wharton School--a lot of their scientists said what the cost would be 
if we were to pass global warming legislation that had been proposed.

over the last 150 years has been a major contributor to the problem. 
Most of these human activities that contribute to this problem relate 
to energy production and use. Carbon dioxide emissions account for 84

blow that Sandy delivered to New York and the whole east coast. It 
created such damage and upheaval to communities and lives. Sandy was a 
horrible event, but the one silver lining in this large awful cloud is 
that people take climate change more seriously. I think most Americans 
agreed that climate change is real, but there was not a sense of 
urgency about climate change pre-Sandy. People said, well, it is 
happening 25 years from now or 50 years from now. Unlike Senator 
Whitehouse, who has a sense of passion and a sense of urgency daily and 
immediately about this, most people said we can let things wait.

specifically, carbon dioxide emissions. It is unfortunate that some of 
our allies, including the French in particular, chose this forum to 
change the terms of international dialogue on this issue. I commend 
President Clinton for resisting these surprising, new pressure tactics 
to shortcut the progress towards a reasonable solution at Kyoto and to 
try to force the United States to endorse an immediate commitment to 
unworkable new goals, thereby, shredding the negotiating process. We 
and the French are both part of negotiations intended as a follow-up to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the so-
called Rio Pact, signed in 1992, and approved by the Senate. The Rio 
Pact called upon the industrialized nations to aim to reduce their

the media and underplayed by the administration. That is the situation 
with regard to natural gas. Governor Bush's energy plan is more than 
just increasing the domestic supply of oil. He would also expand access 
to natural gas on Federal lands and build more gas pipeline. Even the 
Vice President has said natural gas is vital for home heating and 
electricity and fuel for the future. Mr. President, 50 percent of U.S. 
homes, or 56 million homes, use natural gas for heating. It provides 15 
percent of the Nation's electric power; and 95 percent of our new 
electric power plants will be powered by natural gas as a fuel, 
partially of choice but partially of necessity. You cannot build a 
coal-fired plant; you cannot build a nuclear plant; you cannot build a 
new hydroelectric plant. Where are you going to go? You are going to go 
to natural gas. You can get a permit. But all the emphasis of the 
electric industry is towards natural gas. Putting on more pressure 
increases the prices, as I said, from $2.16 a year ago to just over 
$4.50 today. The ratepayers are going to be paying this. They just have 
not seen it yet. It has not been included in your electric bills, but 
it will be very soon, and you will feel it in your heating bill.

intimidate other states from joining the Texan lawsuits. The

that local regulators have the staff, capacity and expertise 
that Washington lacks. When the carbon rules eventually are 
issued, that means the takeover will extend the current

the Production Tax Credit, PTC. Currently, companies that generate 
wind, solar, geothermal, and ``closed-loop'' biomass systems are 
eligible for the PTC which provides a 2.1 cent per kilowatt-hour, kWh, 
benefit for the first 10 years of a renewable energy facility's 
operation. Other technologies, such as incremental hydropower, certain 
generation at non-power facilities, and wave and tidal receive a lesser 
value tax credit of 1.0 cent per kWh. The Hydropower Renewable Energy 
Development Act of 2010 eliminates the distinction between the two 
categories so that all qualified hydropower resources receive the full 
PTC credit. The bill further expands upon the types of hydropower 
resources that can qualify for the PTC, allowing new hydro generation, 
small hydropower under 50 megawatts, lake taps, and pumped storage to 
qualify as well.",1

efficiency research and development authorized last year by the Energy 
Policy Act. The administration's budget request was $462 million short 
of what we agreed made sense for these programs in the Energy Policy 
Act and we provide this additional funding, that will make American 
industries--like our steel, aluminum, and forest industries--more 
competitive by lowering their energy requirements. This funding will 
also allow us to make a stronger push towards the next generation of 
lighting, in which the old incandescent bulb, which wastes most of the 
energy you put in it as heat, is replaced(, by semiconductor lighting 
that is incredibly long-lived and energy efficient.",1

that done, the crap-and-trade bill that is going to create, as former

wildfires, higher sea levels--these things cost American businesses 
enormous amounts of money. According to NOAA, America sustained over

powerplants were natural gas. The advantage to that was they were 
predictable, and easy to build. Investors in utilities could make 
practical business decisions, and they were cleaner than coal in terms 
of nitrogen and sulfur and mercury and carbon. The problem is it drove 
the cost of natural gas from $2 a unit to--at one point in the last few 
years $14 or $15 a unit--and begin to drive almost all of the chemical 
industry jobs and many other manufacturing jobs out of the United 
States. It began to drive up the cost of farming so that many farmers 
have a hard time making a profit because natural gas is used to make 
fertilizer, and that drove up the cost of food to people who couldn't 
afford to pay more for it.",1

powerplants in the Southeast within days or weeks of shutting down. 
Texas, California, and the Midwest now face a similar challenge with 
drought stressing their power production.",1

about capping the output of carbon. I don't think they should. This 
bill would apply to all coal-fired powerplants, including those on the 
drawing boards. It also would give an incentive to the first 30 of 
those plants to meet a high standard of clean coal technology. We don't 
want to encourage the use of natural gas in this bill. That is the last 
thing we want to do. We don't want to discourage the use of coal. We

this country is imported. Last year, we imported an average of 
4,558,000 barrels per day from OPEC countries and 442,000 barrels a day

risk of oilspill. Should an oilspill occur in very cold water, that 
means the damage will be enormous because the oil will break down so 
slowly. So I put forward a keep-it-in-the-ground bill for no offshore 
drilling in the Arctic. And that is not the bill we have had action on 
here in the Senate, but, as it turns out, we have moved forward. Shell, 
which was the leading company to explore offshore in the Arctic, sent 
ships up for several years. They had one calamity after another, one 
disaster after another because of the harsh and challenging 
circumstances. Citizens in the United States, in a grassroots movement,

have another talk I will try to get in next week about what is 
happening around the country right now. It isn't global warming, it is 
global cooling. People forget God is still up there and we go through 
these cycles. I can remember the middle 1970s when they were saying 
there is another ice age coming and we are all going to die. Those same

this chart, I think, demonstrates why the United States was trying to 
insist that sinks be a consideration in emissions. As we see by this


chart, this is North America, and the red indicates the amount of CO2 
emissions. The blue at the bottom displays the sequestration, or the 
sinks, how much of the CO2 we capture by our corn and our sorghum and 
our field crops and our woodlands. And when we compare that with Europe

we have lost eight years' worth of serious efforts to develop 
commercial-scale carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, options. 
This is utterly inexcusable, but by increasing the size and investment 
in government CCS R&D, my legislation attempts to make up for that lost 
time. Our national labs have done groundbreaking work, especially West 
Virginia, but they have not been given the resources they need to truly 
accelerate their research and make it commercially available. In

State Department has said that it would be of negligible environmental

natural gas use by 1 percent and cut prices by well over 30 percent--in 
fact, they said a 37-percent potential cut in prices. Energy efficiency 
is the quickest, cheapest, and cleanest way to bring down energy costs 
for consumers. Meanwhile, as consumers save money, they also reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.",1
1039,2114,   Worldwide energy consumption was about 447 quadrillion BTU in ,1
1040,2115,"We can take a lesson from history. The lack of a coherent energy 
policy has led to the greatest energy price volatility since the energy 
crises of the 1970's.",1
1041,2116,"But we need leadership that is not here yet so that we will do that. 
By the way, big benefits. We could once again become a major exporter. 
We are the most creative, innovative society in the world. Properly 
challenged, we will figure ways to get this alternative energy. We 
could again be a major exporter. Today, we are a big, big importer, as 
you know, $800 billion trade deficit this year.",1
1042,2117,"  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a proud original cosponsor 
of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, which preserves our Nation's 
commitment to the Paris Agreement and keeps our promise to the American 
people to take meaningful action on climate change.",1
1043,2118,"What Secretary Pompeo made very clear is, look, if there is going to 
be investment in the region, we all need to be operating by the same 
rules, and the rules require transparency--transparency when it comes 
to investment in the region, regardless of who is making it. I would 
add to that notion that those who live in the region should benefit 
from any investment in the Arctic, as they are the ones who bear the 
greatest risk in any economic activity, whether it is on the shore or 
in the waters.",1
1044,2119,"Now, I should say I am a longtime supporter of clean energy. In South 
Dakota, we derive a significant amount of our energy from hydropower 
and wind. In fact, in 2020, 80 percent of our utility-scale generation 
was renewal, about half of that from hydro. I have long championed 
cleaner burning renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.",1
1045,2120,"Twenty-seven years ago, Congress, in its wisdom, prohibited the 
production of energy offshore in these areas. Canada produces, Great 
Britain produces, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, all 
environmentally sensitive countries, they produce offshore. We talk 
about Brazil being energy independent because of ethanol. Ethanol was 
just a piece of it. They also went out offshore and produced oil and 
gas and became energy independent, and they don't have to buy this 
expensive energy from anybody. They have their own.",1
1046,2121,"So here we find ourselves in the year 2009 with what the vast 
majority of scientists say is a very serious problem for the future of 
this planet and the security of our civilization. Most of our energy is 
fossil energy. That's the carbon from plants that has accumulated as 
coal and oil over millions of years. As we burn these fossil fuels to 
power our economy, we release that carbon back into the atmosphere. The 
accumulation of these greenhouse gases warm the planet and cause other 
harmful consequences. Therefore, we need to try to find a way to 
decarbonize our energy to bring about a low-carbon future, and thereby 
lower our emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere.",1
1047,2122,"Maryland is one of the most vulnerable States to climate change. Our 
expansive coastline is greatly affected by rapidly rising sea levels 
that are eroding our shoreline and causing flooding. We are also 
starting to see the effects of more frequent extreme weather events, 
such as flooding, heavy precipitation, heat waves, and droughts. This 
will cause environmental damage to our shoreline, the Chesapeake Bay, 
and our water and air quality. It could impact our health by increasing 
respiratory illnesses. And this will cause economic damage by costing 
our coastal cities billions of dollars in lost tourism, our farmers 
heavy losses from droughts and heat waves, and many Marylanders 
property damage from flooding.",1
1048,2123,"These rising concentrations drive global climate change, and they are 
growing as a result of increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. I 
don't believe I need a scientist to tell me something is going on 
there. Disturbingly, most greenhouse gases have a very long life span 
in the atmosphere, ranging from decades to hundreds of years. This 
means that what is emitted today is added to what was emitted in the 
20th century. For example, much of the CO2, much of the 
carbon dioxide, emitted during the Second World War is still with us 
today, and, with each passing year, the concentration is projected to 
grow to ever-higher levels. So, even if it were possible to stop 
emitting greenhouse gases today, that would amount to a very small chip 
in an iceberg of a problem.",1
1049,2124,"In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea ice cover over an area 
10 times as large as the entire State of Maine. In the summer, the 
change has been even more dramatic with twice as much ice loss. The ice 
that remains is as much as 40 percent thinner than it was only a few 
decades ago.",1
1050,2125,"Throughout the summer, and for too long, we have heard the chant from 
the other side that the answer to our energy woes is ``drill, drill, 
drill.'' But Thomas Friedman is correct in stating that it's comparable 
to a group of citizens standing up on the eve of the information 
technology revolution, screaming for more electric typewriters, 
electric typewriters, electric typewriters, when our national chant 
really should be, ``invent, invent, invent.'' It's the only way we're 
going to see our way out of the energy box and crisis that we're facing 
as a Nation and throughout the world. That's what this bill helps us to 
accomplish, with tax incentives for the development of wind and solar, 
fuel cell development, geothermal, electric hybrid technology, but also 
the incentives to enhance conservation and an efficiency program, which 
is another important aspect towards energy independence; extending the 
credit for energy efficient improvements to existing homes, for 
instance, energy efficient commercial buildings, energy efficient 
appliance credits, accelerated depreciation for smart meters and smart 
grid systems, qualified green building and sustainable design projects, 
as well as the extension of the R&D tax credit, which will help spur 
the investment in clean technology and clean energy sources.",1
1051,2126,"California blackouts were the initial impetus for the energy 
legislation we have today. Those blackouts are now hopefully a thing of 
the past. Yet we now are casting this issue as how to respond to the 
threat from Saddam Hussein, that he will cut off supplies from Iraq.

",1
1052,2127,"So, I want to make sure that the committee report language that I 
cited previously does not interfere with these important and worthwhile 
efforts. I would ask my friend from Missouri if these ongoing energy 
conservation and climate-related programs and initiatives, which are 
not intended to directly implement actions called for under the Kyoto 
Protocol, would go forward under this bill?",1
1053,2128,"Now, farmers and ranchers are on the front line of the climate 
crisis, and they are stepping up. Droughts, fires,


and floods are threatening their safety and their livelihoods. My time 
on the Agriculture Committee and time spent with growers in my district 
have shown me that farmers are deeply invested in addressing our 
climate and are eager to be part of the solution.",1
1054,2129,"That is not just the idea of our Energy Committee, which voted 21 to 
1 for a bill that contains this provision and heard a great amount of 
testimony, it is the idea, for example, of the bipartisan National 
Commission on Energy Policy, which pointed out that the energy 
challenges faced by the United States mean many new technologies and, 
unfortunately, ``both public and private investments in research and 
development, demonstration and early deployment of advanced energy 
technologies have been falling short of what is likely to be needed to 
make these technologies available in the time frames and on the scales 
required.''",1
1055,2130,"The President and congressional majority are delaying, suspending, 
and stopping policies and programs that combat climate change because 
of the dark money in politics. Oil and gas, coal, power companies, and 
other special interests feed their campaign and PAC coffers while the 
clear public interest is ignored. We must reform our campaign finance 
system or our climate and the American people will pay a greater and 
greater price.",1
1056,2131,"That is why hydropower is important. That is why when you hear 
comments by people that say take it out, dams are terrible, keep in 
mind that dams do a number of things. One, they provide recreation. 
Two, they provide fisheries. Three, they provide flood control. Four, 
in the West, as you know, in the West it is arid. Out where I live, we 
get all the water we could possibly use for about 5 weeks. It is called 
spring runoff from the mountains.",1
1057,2132,"Yesterday, in a gratuitous assist to Big Oil, Republicans tried to 
kill the Clean Car Factory Fund in order to pay for natural disaster 
relief. This is the program that is helping American companies 
manufacture superefficient vehicles that reduce our dangerous 
dependence on foreign oil from OPEC. But, apparently, that bill wasn't 
radical enough for the Tea Party base. So tonight, they come back and 
they're launching their full-frontal assault on clean energy. 
Yesterday, it was just clean cars. Today, it's solar energy, wind 
energy and all renewables. Tonight, they take out the full assault 
attack.",1

1059,2134,"This appears to be an exercise in politics, not policy. If we get 
serious in


this House about addressing our energy concerns and developing a real 
energy policy, I know we can find common ground. But this week's 
showboating is not serious. I urge my colleagues to oppose these bills.",1
1060,2135,"We are in a sense, by voting on this nomination without this 
information, flying blind. I am an old naval flight officer, 23 years 
as a naval flight officer, retired Navy captain. In Southeast Asia, you 
flew into monsoons and really bad weather sometimes. We never wanted to 
fly blind. We always wanted to have a good weather forecast. We want to 
avoid the places we ought to avoid. We wanted to fly at altitudes that 
were safe. We wanted to use our radars to be able to find the pockets 
to go through to be safe. We never wanted to fly blind.",1
1061,2136,"If the Republican leadership really cared about increasing renewable 
energy use in America, today we would be debating the extension of a 
renewable energy production tax credit, or a renewable portfolio

policy priorities of the renewable energy industry, not gutting our 
national environmental laws.",1

nothing more than advocacy for leftwing causes. It is a violation of 
basic journalistic standards.",1
1064,2139,"Mr. President, renewable energy technologies represent our best hopes 
for reducing air pollution, creating jobs and decreasing our reliance 
on imported oil and finite supplies of fossil fuels. These programs 
promise to supply economically competitive and commercially viable 
energy, while also assisting our Nation in reducing greenhouse gases 
and oil imports. I believe that the Nation should be looking toward 
alternative forms and sources of energy, not taking a step backward by 
cutting funding for these programs.",1

1067,2142,"The Senator from North Dakota put out a statement that says: Assume 
that reconciliation will not be used for changes in legislation related 
to global climate change. Well, that is really nice, but it is a 
statement. The amendment that was offered by the Senator from Nebraska, 
Mr. Johanns, which was adopted here on the floor of the Senate, which 
got 67 votes, was binding, basically said that reconciliation would not 
be used for climate change legislation. It got an overwhelming vote 
here in the Senate. A lot of Democrats voted for it. It got stripped in 
the conference committee, which opens the door to a cap-and-tax 
proposal that, by some estimates, could cost the average family in this 
country over $3,000 a year in higher electricity costs. That is not a 
previous administration issue. This is a real-time budget. This is a 
real-time issue. These are decisions that are being made by the current 
administration and the current Congress, make no mistake about it.",1
1068,2143,"So if we want to create jobs, this is how we can do it. We should 
embrace our energy future and aggressively expand production. If we

the EPA's regulations from moving forward, at least until they fully 
study the impact the rules will have on job losses.",1

energy policy or creating jobs.",1
1070,2145,"My amendment merely says that increased output at existing renewable 
energy facilities should be counted. If an existing renewable energy 
facility were to increase its renewable energy output by 50%, then 
under my amendment that facility would receive credit for that 50%

legislation in our subcommittee, we are going to be having additional 
hearings. Senator Warner, my ranking member, is committed also to 
seeing that the subcommittee produces legislation this year that deals 
with the problem of global warming and the challenge of its impact on 
our world. I want to ensure my friend from Minnesota that one of those 
hearings will include a witness who can educate the committee and 
discuss the proposal of the Senator from Minnesota for a clean energy 
portfolio standard. Personally, I think his idea is a constructive one, 
a thoughtful one, a progressive one, and deserves serious 
consideration.",1
1074,2149,"This next chart reveals the problem this Nation will face in the 
future as increasing amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the 
air from the electric industry. Powerplants currently generate close to 
40 percent of the nationwide emissions of this pollutant, a gas chiefly 
responsible for global warming and the creation of a greenhouse effect. 
The resulting climate change has the potential to inflict devastating 
damage on our environment for many years, well into the future. Unlike 
other pollutants, carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for decades. 
If we are to protect our children's future, we must act now. As you can 
see, my bill, designed to bring the industry back to the 1990 standard, 
requires a significant 13 percent reduction by the year 2005 and will 
double that by the year 2015.",1
1075,2150,"I mentioned that one of the costs of oil for American consumers is 
the fact that our dollar has decreased in value relative to other 
currencies. There was a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal 
which showed that the price of oil based upon gold or the value of the 
Euro has remained relatively constant, whereas compared to the price of 
a dollar, it has increased dramatically, because the dollar is worth 
less money. If a dollar doesn't buy you as much, you have to have a lot 
more of them to buy the same quantity of gasoline. I filled up two cars 
this weekend. In both cases, I could see the fact my dollars weren't 
going as far as they used to. That was one of the reasons I paid more 
for the gas I purchased.",1
