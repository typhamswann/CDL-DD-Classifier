I don’t agree with much of the analysis, but think it’s a good faith effort to explore the issue. More broadly, the “subsidy conversation"" is gaining more traction politically and in the media – but as expected, has quickly become partisan, polemic and overly simplistic on all sides (for just one example, check out the comments thread at this article). It’s a much, much bigger and more nuanced conversation that I’ve tried to touch on in several blogs, and through fact sheets on innovation and deployment. I find that certain questions tend to go unanswered, which is unfortunate, as addressing them could really illuminate the debate: 1) why do we have subsidies in the first place (IMO: to address market failures and barriers that are stifling socially optimal levels of investment) 2) how can they be most effective (IMO: by providing clear and stable support mechanisms that encourage diversity in innovation) and, 3) importantly, when should they end (IMO: when technologies mature and a level-playing field exists in a competitive marketplace).

I covered Israel for ABC News in 198486 and had returned to the area on writing assignments three times between 2002 and 2007. Like many other journalists, I had a sense of hopelessness produced by my experiences in the region. After all, this conflict has survived war, peace negotiations, terrorist assaults on civilians, an authorized suicide-bombing campaign, presidential arm-twisting, even proximity talks. So it was with no great optimism that I undertook another journey.",['0 No claim'],

2040,william_kattrup@brown.edu,711,"These findings are but another common example of an important aspect of earth's climate and how it operates: it oscillates back and forth between centennial-scale intervals of relative cold and warmth with a full-period temporal mean of approximately 1500 years (see Climate Oscillations (Millennial Variability) in our Subject Index). Viewed in this light, the development of the Current Warm Period over the past century or so is readily recognized to be nothing more than the most recent - and expected - manifestation of this natural cycling of earth's climate; and this knowledge suggests that our current relative warmth is likely not a response to the historical increase in the atmosphere's CO 2 concentration.

But Obama's budget plan has penciled in more than $600 billion in revenue from an emissions trading bill in his budget plan, and hence the idea of attaching emissions trading to the budget reconciliation process, thus allowing it to be passed by a simple majority vote of Congress and making it immune to the Senate filibuster. Above all, it is an attempt to end-run the deliberative process of the legislative branch. An emissions trading bill simply cannot survive the light of a sustained, open debate in Congress.","['4.1.1 Policy increases costs', '4.4 Climate policy is too difficult']",
