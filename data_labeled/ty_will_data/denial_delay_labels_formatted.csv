I find that certain questions tend to go unanswered, which is unfortunate, as addressing them could really illuminate the debate: 1) why do we have subsidies in the first place (IMO: to address market failures and barriers that are stifling socially optimal levels of investment) 2) how can they be most effective (IMO: by providing clear and stable support mechanisms that encourage diversity in innovation) and, 3) importantly, when should they end (IMO: when technologies mature and a level-playing field exists in a competitive marketplace).

716,"A similar dynamic is working on the purely domestic level, which is the third moving part of this story. Prospects for the passage of a ""cap and trade"" GHG emissions reduction plan in Congress do not look good at the moment, again because too many Democrats in the heartland states that would be hit hard by sharply higher energy costs are now hesitating or opposing the idea. But Obama's budget plan has penciled in more than $600 billion in revenue from an emissions trading bill in his budget plan, and hence the idea of attaching emissions trading to the budget reconciliation process, thus allowing it to be passed by a simple majority vote of Congress and making it immune to the Senate filibuster. Above all, it is an attempt to end-run the deliberative process of the legislative branch. An emissions trading bill simply cannot survive the light of a sustained, open debate in Congress.",ty_pham-swann@brown.edu,william_kattrup@brown.edu,1,1
